## what is Markdown?
see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz allowing people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".
